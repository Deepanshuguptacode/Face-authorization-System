Date: October 24, 2025
Analysis: Performance at Threshold 0.6 using previously computed embeddings

================================================================================
                          DATASET 1 RESULTS
================================================================================

OVERALL PERFORMANCE AT THRESHOLD 0.6:
--------------------------------------
  ❌ Accuracy:   65.50%   (Very Low - 32% drop from optimal threshold)
  ✓  Precision: 100.00%   (Perfect - No false acceptances)
  ❌ Recall:     31.00%   (Very Poor - 69% of legitimate users rejected)
  ❌ F1 Score:   47.33%   (Poor balance between precision and recall)

CONFUSION MATRIX:
-----------------
                    Predicted
                Same    Different
Actual Same      31        69      ← 69 legitimate users REJECTED
    Different     0       100      ← All imposters correctly rejected

TRUE POSITIVES (TP):    31  (Only 31 out of 100 same-person pairs accepted)
FALSE NEGATIVES (FN):   69  (69 legitimate users would be DENIED access)
TRUE NEGATIVES (TN):   100  (All different-person pairs correctly rejected)
FALSE POSITIVES (FP):    0  (No unauthorized access - perfect security)

WHAT THIS MEANS:
• Out of 10 legitimate users, only 3 would be granted access
• 7 out of 10 legitimate users would be REJECTED
• System would be nearly unusable for legitimate users
• Perfect security but terrible user experience

                         WHY THRESHOLD 0.6 FAILS
================================================================================

SIMILARITY STATISTICS FROM OUR TESTS:

Dataset 1:
  Same Person Mean Similarity:      0.5324
  Same Person Similarity Range:     0.0510 - 0.8292
  Different Person Mean Similarity: 0.0139
  Different Person Max Similarity:  0.2413

Dataset 2:
  Same Person Mean Similarity:      0.5428
  Same Person Similarity Range:     0.1309 - 0.8206
  Different Person Mean Similarity: 0.0035
  Different Person Max Similarity:  0.1873

THE PROBLEM:
• Threshold 0.6 is ABOVE the mean similarity for same-person pairs!
• Mean similarity is ~0.53-0.54, but threshold is 0.6
• This means only above-average similarity pairs are accepted
• 50-70% of legitimate same-person pairs fall below 0.6
• The threshold is TOO STRICT for practical use

WHY THRESHOLD 0.3 WORKS:
• It's well above different-person mean (~0.01)
• It's well below same-person mean (~0.54)
• It catches all different-person attempts (max is 0.24)
• It accepts most legitimate users (95-96%)
• Perfect balance between security and usability

================================================================================
                           RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

❌ DO NOT USE THRESHOLD 0.6
---------------------------
Reasons:
  • 65-70% accuracy is UNACCEPTABLE for production systems
  • 60-70% of legitimate users would be DENIED access
  • Terrible user experience would lead to system abandonment
  • Users would need multiple attempts or give up
  • No practical benefit over threshold 0.3 (same precision)

✅ RECOMMENDED: USE THRESHOLD 0.3
---------------------------------
Reasons:
  • 97.5-98% accuracy - Excellent performance
  • 100% precision - No unauthorized access (same security as 0.6)
  • 95-96% recall - Most legitimate users accepted
  • Only 4-5% false rejection rate (manageable with retry)
  • Optimal balance between security and usability
  • Suitable for production deployment

ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS (if higher security needed):
  • Threshold 0.35-0.40: 92.5-96.5% accuracy, still 100% precision
  • Multi-Factor Authentication: Keep 0.3, add PIN/password
  • Adaptive Thresholds: Use 0.3 normally, increase for suspicious activity

================================================================================
                              CONCLUSION
================================================================================

THRESHOLD 0.6 SUMMARY:

Dataset 1:  65.50% Accuracy | 100% Precision | 31% Recall | 47.33% F1
Dataset 2:  69.50% Accuracy | 100% Precision | 39% Recall | 56.12% F1

VERDICT: ❌ NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION

The threshold of 0.6 provides:
  ✓ Perfect security (100% precision, 0 false positives)
  ✗ Terrible usability (60-70% of legitimate users rejected)
  ✗ 32-34% lower accuracy than optimal threshold
  ✗ No advantage over threshold 0.3 (which also has 100% precision)

The system would reject the majority of legitimate users, making it
practically unusable despite perfect security. This is a classic case
of over-optimization for security at the expense of usability.

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Use Threshold 0.3 for optimal balance
• Same security (100% precision)
• Much better usability (95-96% recall)
• 32-34% higher accuracy (97.5-98%)
• Production-ready performance
