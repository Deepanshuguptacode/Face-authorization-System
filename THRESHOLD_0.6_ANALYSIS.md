## Analysis and Insights

### Performance Summary at Threshold 0.6

#### Strengths ✅
1. **Perfect Precision (100%)** - No false acceptances in either dataset
2. **Maximum Security** - Zero unauthorized persons would be granted access
3. **Consistent Security** - Both datasets show 0 false positives

#### Critical Weaknesses ⚠️
1. **Very Low Accuracy**
   - Dataset 1: Only 65.50% accuracy (vs 97.50% at threshold 0.3)
   - Dataset 2: Only 69.50% accuracy (vs 98.00% at threshold 0.3)

2. **Extremely Poor Recall**
   - Dataset 1: 69% of legitimate users rejected
   - Dataset 2: 61% of legitimate users rejected
   - This means **most authorized users cannot access the system**

3. **Unacceptable User Experience**
   - Dataset 1: 6-7 out of 10 legitimate users would be denied access
   - Dataset 2: 6 out of 10 legitimate users would be denied access
   - Users would need multiple attempts or alternative authentication

4. **Low F1 Score**
   - Dataset 1: 47.33% (vs 97.44% at threshold 0.3)
   - Dataset 2: 56.12% (vs 97.96% at threshold 0.3)
   - Poor balance between precision and recall

### Why Threshold 0.6 Performs Poorly

Looking at the similarity statistics from our tests:

**Dataset 1:**
- Same Person Mean Similarity: **0.5324**
- Same Person Range: 0.0510 - 0.8292

**Dataset 2:**
- Same Person Mean Similarity: **0.5428**
- Same Person Range: 0.1309 - 0.8206

**Problem:** The threshold of 0.6 is **above the mean similarity** for same-person pairs!

This means:
- Only pairs with above-average similarity are accepted
- Approximately 50-60% of legitimate same-person pairs fall below 0.6
- The threshold is too strict for practical use

### Why Threshold 0.3 is Optimal

**Dataset 1 & 2:**
- Different Person Mean Similarity: **0.0139 / 0.0035**
- Different Person Max: **0.2413 / 0.1873**

The threshold of 0.3 is:
- Well above the mean of different-person similarities
- Above the maximum observed different-person similarity
- Still maintains high recall (95-96%)
- Achieves perfect or near-perfect precision

## Recommendations

### ❌ DO NOT Use Threshold 0.6
**Reasons:**
1. 65-70% accuracy is **unacceptable** for production
2. 60-70% of legitimate users would be **denied access**
3. Poor user experience would lead to system abandonment
4. No practical benefit over threshold 0.3

### ✅ RECOMMENDED: Use Threshold 0.3
**Reasons:**
1. **97.5-98% accuracy** - Excellent performance
2. **100% precision** - No unauthorized access (same as 0.6)
3. **95-96% recall** - Most legitimate users accepted
4. **Optimal balance** between security and usability

### Alternative: If Higher Security is Required

If you need even higher security than threshold 0.3 provides, consider:

1. **Threshold 0.35-0.40**
   - Dataset 1: 93.5-96.5% accuracy
   - Dataset 2: 92.5-96.5% accuracy
   - Still maintains 100% precision
   - Recall: 85-93%

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Keep threshold at 0.3
   - Add PIN, password, or second authentication factor
   - Better than making face recognition too strict

3. **Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Use 0.3 for first attempt
   - Use 0.35-0.40 if first attempt seems suspicious
   - Combine with behavioral analysis

## Conclusion

### Summary for Threshold 0.6

**Dataset 1:**
- ❌ **Overall Accuracy: 65.50%** - Significantly below acceptable standards
- ✓ **Precision: 100%** - Maintains perfect security
- ❌ **Recall: 31%** - 69% of legitimate users rejected
- ❌ **Not recommended for production use**

**Dataset 2:**
- ❌ **Overall Accuracy: 69.50%** - Below acceptable standards
- ✓ **Precision: 100%** - Maintains perfect security
- ❌ **Recall: 39%** - 61% of legitimate users rejected
- ❌ **Not recommended for production use**

### Final Recommendation

**Use Threshold 0.3** for optimal balance:
- Dataset 1: 97.50% accuracy
- Dataset 2: 98.00% accuracy
- 100% precision (same security as 0.6)
- 95-96% recall (much better user experience)

Threshold 0.6 provides no practical advantage over 0.3 while significantly degrading system usability. The 32-34 percentage point drop in accuracy makes it unsuitable for production deployment.
