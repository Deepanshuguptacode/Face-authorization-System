SYMBOLS EXPLAINED:
------------------
✅ = Verification successful
❌ = Verification failed (no match)
🔍 = Searching/comparing
⚡ = Performance metrics
🏁 = Total time
📊 = Similarity score
🔴 = Rejection details
✗ = Failed threshold check
✓ = Passed threshold check
⚠️ = Warning/attention needed

SIMILARITY SCORE INTERPRETATION:
---------------------------------
0.00 - 0.15  →  Completely different faces (clear rejection)
0.15 - 0.20  →  Different faces (safe rejection)
0.20 - 0.24  →  Somewhat similar but different (correct rejection)
0.25 - 0.30  →  THRESHOLD ZONE (0.25 = optimal cutoff)
0.30 - 0.50  →  Same person (good match)
0.50 - 0.70  →  Same person (excellent match)
0.70 - 1.00  →  Same person (nearly identical)

GAP FROM THRESHOLD:
-------------------
Gap > 0.10   →  Clear rejection (completely different)
Gap 0.05-0.10 →  Safe rejection (different person)
Gap 0.01-0.05 →  Correct rejection (close but different)
Gap < 0.01   →  Very close! May need retry/better conditions
Gap = 0.00   →  Exactly at threshold (edge case)
Gap < 0      →  Match found (similarity > threshold)

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:
--------------------

If Best Similarity < 0.15:
  → Complete stranger, clear security threat

If Best Similarity 0.15-0.20:
  → Different person, safe rejection

If Best Similarity 0.20-0.24:
  → Close but no match, possibly similar features

If Best Similarity 0.24-0.249:
  → VERY CLOSE! Consider:
     • Ask user to try again
     • Check lighting conditions
     • Verify camera angle
     • May need re-registration

If Multiple Users Near Threshold:
  → Possible family members or similar features
  → System correctly rejecting all (good security)

If All Scores Very Low (<0.10):
  → Completely unregistered face
  → Possible spoofing attempt with photo/video
  → Clear security rejection

================================================================================
                         DEBUGGING TIPS
================================================================================

CASE 1: Legitimate user rejected (similarity 0.24-0.249)
SOLUTION:
  • Improve lighting
  • Try different angle
  • Remove glasses/hat if worn during registration
  • Re-register with multiple photos
  • Check if threshold too high (consider 0.23 if many false rejections)

CASE 2: All similarities very low (<0.10)
POSSIBLE CAUSES:
  • Completely different person (correct rejection) ✓
  • Bad image quality
  • Poor face detection
  • Spoofing attempt

CASE 3: Multiple users with similar high scores (0.20-0.24)
INTERPRETATION:
  • Generic facial features
  • Similar-looking people registered
  • System working correctly (rejecting all) ✓

CASE 4: Inconsistent matches for same user
SOLUTION:
  • Register user with multiple angles
  • Use better lighting during registration
  • Ensure consistent camera quality
  • Re-register problematic users
